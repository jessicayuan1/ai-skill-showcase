# AI Skill Showcase

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is designed as a lightweight take-home assessment to help us get to know your skills with AI/ML, Python, and Git workflows.  
It should take **1â€“2 hours** and is meant to be fun and flexible.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
- Demonstrate basic familiarity with **Python + Jupyter/Colab**.
- Showcase ability to **train or apply a simple model**.
- Practice working with **Git branches, commits, and merge requests**.
- Give you room to **add your own creativity**.

---

## Steps 

1. **Fork or clone** this repository.
2. **Create a new branch** named `feature/<your-name>`.
3. Add a Google Colab named `<your_name>_showcase.ipynb` that includes:
   - **Step 1:** Generate or load **two images** (from data, synthetic, or AI model).
   - **Step 2:** Apply a transformation or train a simple model that produces different results.
   - **Step 3:** Display both original and transformed/predicted outcomes side-by-side.
4. **Commit and push** your branch with just **one** ipynb file (edit requirements if needed, making sure it's up to date with master for easy merging).
5. **Open a Merge Request (PR)** into `main`, document and explain your code in the description, then request review.
6. Be prepared to explain in the interview along with any technical skills if we ask!

## Rubric
- Notebook runs end-to-end without errors.
- Code is clear, commented, and reproducible.
- Explanation in the PR is **not written by GPT**, but with your own words. Doesn't have to be crazy.
- Different from previous submissions. No p71s out here
- Shows **two distinct images/outcomes**.
- Follows Git workflow (branch, commit, MR).
- You can use AI to bounce off ideas and get clarity, but we expect you to understand what you're writing
- Shows your commitment and your technical skills (it is a team project after all)

## ðŸš€ Example
Weâ€™ve provided [`example.ipynb`](./example.ipynb) as a Google Colab-friendly demo.  
It trains a simple classifier and shows two separate predictions to illustrate the workflow.
Check out everyone's notebooks!
Great ideas so far:
- Creating heatmaps sourced from images online (Advitiya's)
- William's Pokemon card classifier
- Malaria classification by Andrew Yang
